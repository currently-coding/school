- command line disassembler
- gets information about executable files and objects

## How to use
```terminal
objdump -R <executable>
```
- `-R` displays list of functions in the [[GHH/Linux Exploits/GOT]]

- `puts()`  has this address: **`...4008`**
### Locate the Address called to get the Function
```terminal
objdump -M intel -d -j .plt <executable> | grep <unique address identifier>
``` 
- `-M intel` switches to [[Assembly#AT&T vs NASM|Intel Assembler Syntax]] instead of [[Assembly#AT&T|AT&T]]
- `-d` = `disassemble`
- `-j .plt` specifies the [[Coding Basics/Memory/Sections]] we want to display

```terminal
objdump -d ./hello.out | grep 4008
```

-> Syntax Differences become visible([[Assembly#AT&T vs NASM]])
-> **`1040`** is address called by the [[GHH/Linxux Eploits/PLT]]
### Find call to `puts()`
- in `.text` [[Sections#.text|section]]
```terminal
objdump -M intel -d -j .text <executable> | grep <unique part of address>
```
-> see aforementioned syntax explanation [[objdump#Locate the Address called to get the Function|here]]
